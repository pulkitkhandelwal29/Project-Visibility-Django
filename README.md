Project Visibility helps a user to access a website using voice commands. The target audience of this project are visually impaired people. This can also be helpful to the government as well as a normal website user.  We spotted that No means of technology existed, which was helping visually impaired people to access information via websites. 

### HOW TO USE:
* Introductory audio plays at the beginning.
* Choose the desired option from the options list.
