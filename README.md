We've noticed that visually impaired people of our society face issues when it comes to accessing and interacting with websites, as there is no proper medium for them. To solve this problem we've created this project.

Project VISIBILITY would empower visually impaired people and make them digitally literate.

We have used speech recognition functionality so visually impaired people can access websites easily and thus removing the technological barrier. We've deployed, shared and also published an article regarding the project. 

### HOW TO USE:
* Introductory audio plays at the beginning.
* Choose the desired option from the options list.
* Contents of the page will be read aloud
* Website too will be redirected
* Speak Stop to stop the website
* Double click anywhere on the screen to relaunch
* Speak only when entire audio stops 

### Tools and Technologies:
* HTML,CSS,Bootstrap
* JavaScript ES6 (Speech Recognition API) 
* Backend Technology (Django Web Framework)
* Python<br>
	<br>Web scraping with Beautifulsoup, Requests and Urllib
